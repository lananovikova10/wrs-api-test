## Grammar correction 
Although LanguageTool is a great engine for catching grammar and stylistic mistakes, it is rule-based, meaning that it depends on a set of rules that humans define. By properly training our GEC model, we've managed to outperform LanguageTool and catch a lot more mistakes.

It has some advanced grammar checks under the hood, like consistent verb tense usage, adjective/adverb confusion, relative clause commas, and so on.

I am see people. This people big.

Grazie is to improved the quality of grammar error correction. It might be a destination you stumbled across on a must see list on a travel blog or heard was a can't miss landmark.

Grazie also detects spelling errors and mistypes. For example, arguement, absense, adress.

## Natural language completion

Grazie Professional takes the context of what you have written before and suggests words, phrases, or even whole sentences as you type. It works as an invisible writing assistant and helps you remove writer's block or get an alternative view on the subject.

So when you put the cursor after the previous word it should display the suggestion either in the line or in the drop-down, depending on selected setting, and complete the suggestion by Tab. Both modes should work in .topic files.

## Part-of-speech highlighting 

Trim and tighten: You can employ syntax highlighting which helps you spot weak verbs, unwanted repetitions, and eliminate clutter. Together with Style Check it'll make you a more persuasive writer.

It can highlight adjectives, nouns, verbs and the like in different colors, which may prevent overdecorating.
